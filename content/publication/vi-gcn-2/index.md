abstract: We propose a framework that lifts the capabilities of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to scenarios where no input graph is given and increases their robustness to adversarial attacks. We formulate a joint probabilistic model that considers a prior distribution over graphs along with a GCN-based likelihood and develop a stochastic variational inference algorithm to estimate the graph posterior and the GCN parameters jointly. To address the problem of propagating gradients through latent variables drawn from discrete distributions, we use their continuous relaxations known as Concrete distributions. We show that, on real datasets, our approach can outperform state-of-the-art Bayesian and non-Bayesian graph neural network algorithms on the task of semi-supervised classification in the absence of graph data and when the network structure is subjected to adversarial perturbations.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Our proposed framework uses a joint probabilistic model and stochastic variational inference to improve the performance and robustness of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in scenarios without input graph data, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms on semi-supervised classification tasks.

This paper is a follow-up to our [working paper](../vi-gcn-1), previously
presented at the NeurIPS2019 Graph Representation Learning Workshop, now with 
significantly expanded experimental analyses.
