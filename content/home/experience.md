        As a student researcher at [Secondmind](https://www.secondmind.ai/) (formerly Prowler.io), a research-intensive AI startup renowned for its innovations in [Bayesian optimization (BO)](tag/bayesian-optimization/) and [Gaussian processes (GPs)](tag/gaussian-processes),  I contributed impactful research and open-source code aligned with their focus on advancing probabilistic ML. Specifically, I developed [open-source software](https://github.com/secondmind-labs/GPflux) to facilitate efficiently sampling from GPs, substantially improving their accessibility and functionality. Additionally, I led a research initiative to improve the integration of neural networks (NNs) with GP approximations, bridging a critical gap between probabilistic methods and deep learning. These efforts culminated in a [research paper](publication/spherical-features-gaussian-process) that was selected for an oral presentation at the prestigious International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

        During my tenure, I had the privilege of collaborating with Vincent Dutordoir and Victor Picheny.

        I spent the Summer-Fall of 2019 at Amazon in Berlin, Germany, conducting research in the area of [AutoML](/tag/automl/) in contribution to the [Automatic Model Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08489) service on [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). I was fortunate to been given the opportunity to work with eminent researchers in the field, [Matthias Seeger](https://mseeger.github.io/), [Aaron Klein](https://aaronkl.github.io/), and [CÃ©dric Archambeau](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/c.archambeau/). Together, we tackled the challenges of extending *multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization* with *asynchronous parallelism*. The research developed during my internship culminated in a [research paper](publication/async-multi-fidelity-hpo/) and the release of our [code](https://autogluon.mxnet.io/api/autogluon.searcher.html#gpmultifidelitysearcher) as part of the open-source [AutoGluon](https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon) library.

        After NICTA was subsumed under CSIRO (Australia's national science agency), I continued as a member of the [Inference Systems Engineering](#) team, working to apply probabilistic machine learning to a multitude of problem domains, including spatial inference and Bayesian experimental design, with an emphasis on scalability. In this time, I led the design and implementation of new [microservices](https://data61.csiro.au/en/Our-Research/Our-Work/Safety-and-Security/Understanding-Risk/Determinant) and contributed to the development of [open-source libraries](https://github.com/gradientinstitute/aboleth) for large-scale Bayesian deep learning.

         During this period, I also served a brief stint with the [Graph Analytics Engineering](#) team (the team behind [StellarGraph](https://www.stellargraph.io/)), where I contributed to research into *graph representation learning* from a probabilistic perspective. These efforts culminated in a [research paper](publication/vi-gcn-2/) that went on to be awarded a spotlight presentation at the field's [premier conference](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020).

        As a software engineer with a specialization in machine learning, I was a member of a team of machine learning researchers and engineers engaged in an interdisciplinary collaboration with leading researchers from multiple areas of the natural sciences, as part of the [Big Data Knowledge Discovery](https://research.csiro.au/data61/big-data-knowledge-discovery/)   initiative sponsored by the [Science Industry Endowment Fund (SIEF)](https://sief.org.au/). During this time I helped lead the development and release of numerous [open-source libraries](https://github.com/NICTA/revrand) for applying Bayesian machine learning at scale.
