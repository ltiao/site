Hi. I am Louis Tiao, a machine learning (ML) research scientist with a broad 
interest in probabilistic ML and a particular focus 
on [approximate Bayesian inference](tag/gaussian-processes) 
and [Gaussian processes](tag/gaussian-processes), and their applications 
to [Bayesian optimization](tag/bayesian-optimization) 
and [graph representation learning](#).

I recently submitted my [PhD thesis]({{< relref "/publication/phd-thesis" >}}) at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), where I worked with [Edwin Bonilla](#) and [Fabio Ramos](#).
Our research has garnered recognition at premier conferences like [NeurIPS](#) and [ICML](#), where our work has routinely been selected as Oral/Spotlight talks.
<!-- My [thesis], now under submission, explores the integration of probabilistic ML with deep learning. -->
<!-- Some of our work has been recognized at premier conferences 
such as [NeurIPS](#) and [ICML](#), where they have been highlighted as 
oral/spotlight talks. -->
Before pursuing my doctorate, I obtained a BSc in Computer Science with 
First Class Honours from 
the [University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney)](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), 
where I majored in artificial intelligence (AI) and minored in mathematics.
I began my professional career in ML as a software engineer
at [National ICT Australia (NICTA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NICTA), 
which [later merged](https://www.zdnet.com/article/csiro-swallows-nicta-to-form-data61/) 
into [CSIRO](www.csiro.au)'s [Data61](https://research.csiro.au/data61/)---the 
AI research division of Australia's national science agency.

During my PhD, I've had the privilege of collaborating with [exceptional people][] through multiple rewarding industrial research internships.
In the Summer and Fall of 2019, I completed a research internship at [Amazon][]
in Berlin, Germany, where I worked with [Matthias Seeger](https://mseeger.github.io/), [Cédric Archambeau](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/c.archambeau/), and [Aaron Klein](https://aaronkl.github.io/).
Between Fall 2021 and Spring 2022, I worked with [Vincent Dutordoir](#) 
and [Victor Picheny](#) at [Secondmind Labs](https://www.secondmind.ai/) in Cambridge, UK. 
More recently, in Summer 2022, I extended my stay in Cambridge and returned to [Amazon][],
reuniting virtually with my former Berlin team.

<!-- once again to work with Aaron, Cédric, and Matthias. -->

<!-- As a researcher, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of machine learning, and I aspire to make meaningful contributions to the field. My journey has been enriched by the outstanding people I've had the opportunity to collaborate with, both in academia and industry. I look forward to continuing my exploration of cutting-edge ML techniques and their applications, driving innovation, and advancing the field for the benefit of society. -->
